declarationstmt = "DECLARE" type (IDENTIFIER | arraydecl){","(IDENTIFIER | array)}

type = "BOOL" | "CHAR" | "INT" | "FLOAT" | "STRING"

array = "LIST" IDENTIFIER"[" number "] 

cmpdstmt = "{" stmtlist "}"

stmtlist = stmt | stmt ";" stmtlist

stmt = simplstmt | structstmt

simplstmt = assignstmt | iostmt | declarationstmt

assignstmt = IDENTIFIER "=" expression

expression = expression operator term | term

term = term operator factor | factor

factor = "(" expression ")" | IDENTIFIER

iostmt = ("SCAN" | "PRINT") IDENTIFIER{","IDENTIFIER}

structstmt = cmpdstmt | ifstmt | whilestmt

ifstmt = "IF" condition "THEN" stmt ["ELSE" stmt]

whilestmt = "WHILE" condition "DO" stmt

condition = expression RELATION expression |conditon logicalop condition

RELATION = "<" | "<=" | "==" | "<>" | ">=" | ">"

logicalop = "&&" | "||"
